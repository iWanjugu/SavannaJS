        -   console.log a paragraph about yourself using the appropriate variables to insert the relevant information in the appropriate places.

    <!--Manipulating the DOM-->

<!--
    console.log is great for debugging, but more frequently, we'll want our JavaScript to change the visible page. First, let's ask the document to return us the first element that it finds that matches a valid CSS selector.

    Open this page (http://morning-bastion-77397.herokuapp.com/students/examples/selecting.html) and try the following in the JavaScript console:

    > document.body
    > document.querySelector('p')
    > document.querySelector('#primary')
    > document.querySelector('.important')
    > document.querySelector('p.important').textContent
    > document.querySelector('#nav ol li').textContent
-->
    <script>
    //Rewrites what is on the page to what is in the quotes below"
    document.querySelector('h1, p').textContent = "I'm on the page!"

    document.querySelector('h1').textContent = "Behold! For I am a mighty web document!"

    var big_shot = document.querySelector('#primary')
    big_shot.textContent = "Flippin' heck, I'm by far the most important element around!"
    document.querySelector('.important').textContent = "Do all .important elements change or only one?"

    </script>
